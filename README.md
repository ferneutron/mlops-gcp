## Contributing to the Project

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here's a guide on how to contribute effectively:

### 1. Create a branch

Create a new branch from the `develop` branch:

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b your-name/feature-name
```

Replace `your-name` with your actual GitHub username and `feature-name` with a descriptive name for the feature you are working on.

### 2. Submit changes

- **Create a pull request:** Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch of the main repository.
- **Request review:** In the pull request, add `@ferneutron` and another member from the team as reviewers.
- **Provide a clear description:** In the pull request description, explain what your changes do, why they are necessary, and any relevant context.


### 3. Pull Request Review Process

* Your pull request will be reviewed by the designated reviewers.
* If there are any issues or feedback, you will be notified and asked to address them.
* Once all feedback has been addressed and the reviewers are satisfied, the pull request will be merged into the `develop` branch.

### 4. Important Notes

* **Maintain a consistent workflow:** Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
* **Keep your pull request focused:** Aim to address a single issue or feature per pull request.
* **Communicate effectively:** Discuss your changes and any potential concerns with the reviewers.
* **Be patient:** The review process may take some time, especially for larger changes.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your contributions are valuable and smoothly integrated into the project. Thank you for your contributions!
